# VeoMate

**The Context-Aware Canvas Platform.**

VeoMate is an open-source initiative designed to eliminate context switching in modern workflows. We are building a platform that fuses the visual clarity of a canvas with the structured management of project tools and the real-time communication of chat applications.

## Core Philosophy

Work communication should be effortless and maintainable. Current tools force you to jump between tabs—diagrams in one place, tasks in another, and chats in a third. VeoMate unifies these into a single, cohesive interface.

## Key Features

- **Visual Project Mapping**: Map your entire project structure using nodes and branches on an infinite canvas.
- **Contextual Communication**: The chat sidebar automatically adapts to your focus. Click a node, and the conversation snaps to that specific context.
- **Structured Flexibility**: Combine the freedom of a whiteboard with the organization of structured task management.

## Project Status

VeoMate is in early active development.

Current focus:
- Core canvas data model
- Node based context handling
- Context aware chat behavior
